P-value test of correlation of tempertures. P-value was found to be $0.0004$ so it seemed reasonable to reject the null hypothesis
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
We were considering the correlation between temperatures in successive years. This is difficult as you cannot simply compare succesive years as they are not independant.
We instead compared pairs of succesive years vs randomely sampled years.
\section{Conclusion}
This lead to a p value of 0.0004 which suggests that temperatures are indeed correlated.
