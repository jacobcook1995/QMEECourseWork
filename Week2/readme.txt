Scripts in Code:
basic_io.py: Python scripts that opens a file to read, reads and prints data from this file, then closes. This is then repeated but this time blank lines are removed. Then a list of 100 numbers is written to a new file. Then pickle is used to save a dictionary object to a file. This data is then loaded and printed.
basic_csv.py: Reads csv data from a file, then uses an imported function csv reader to read the row data. the csv file is printed line by line and outputs the species name on its own. then a new file is created and the speices name and body mass data is written to it.
