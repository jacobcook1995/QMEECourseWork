Scripts in Code:
basic_io.py: Python scripts that opens a file to read, reads and prints data from this file, then closes. This is then repeated but this time blank lines are removed. Then a list of 100 numbers is written to a new file. Then pickle is used to save a dictionary object to a file. This data is then loaded and printed.
basic_csv.py: Reads csv data from a file, then uses an imported function csv reader to read the row data. the csv file is printed line by line and outputs the species name on its own. then a new file is created and the speices name and body mass data is written to it.
boilerplate.py: Demonstration of writing a python function, it announces that it is a boilerplate function. This is done within the main function which is then called.
using_name.py: Python script that tells you whether it's being run by itself or being imported from another module
sysargv.py: Python script that outputs the name of the script, then the number of arguments, then outputs the arguments
scope.py: Python script to demonstrate the use of global and local variables.
control_flow.py: Python script to demonstrate use of functions. The cript has functions to check if a number is even, what its largest factor up to five is, whether a number is prime and to list all the primes up to a number
cfexercises: Python script to demonstrate the control flow. First part is split in five and outputs 'hello' 36 times controlled by multiple control flow methods. Part 1) 14 outputs , Part 2) 4 outputs , Part 3) 5 outputs , Part 4) 5 outputs , Part 5) 8 outputs. Theres then a series of foo functions defined. foo1 gives the root of a number, foo2 returns the largest of two numbers, foo3 puts a list of 3 numbers in order of inncreasing size, foo4 returns x!, foo5 does the same but recursively.
loops.py: A python script that demonstrates both for loops and while loops
oaks.py: A python script that finds the oak trees from a list using both for loops and species comprehensions, this is done for both upper and lower case.
lc1.py: script that breaks down a list of birds into smaller sub-lists does this via both list comprehension and convential loops.
lc2.py: script that breaks down a list of rainfall into smaller lists based on amount of rain does this via both list comprehension and convential loops
dictionary.py: script creates a dictionary from hard coded data using list comprehensions
tuple.py: script that prints a tuple of tuples as indvidual lines through use of list comprehensions
align_segs.py: script that reads in DNA sequences from a file and then finds the length of the longest overlap and then prints said overlap and its length. Can read two sequences written in csv format.
test_control_flow.py: script that tests one of the functions in control flow in order to demonstrate doctest
debugme.py: Python script to test the debugger on
test_oaks.py: Python script to be fixed using the Python debugger.
